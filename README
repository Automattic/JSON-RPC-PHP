A JSON-RPC class, written in PHP5.

It provides a simple means to process JSON-RPC 2.0 requests objects.
It should be paired with additional transport extension classes, an example http server class is included.

Presently it only reflects functions shared in the global space, support for singleton or more involved class invocations could be added.

Still a work in progress. Suggestions welcome :)
